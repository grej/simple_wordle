# Simple Wordle Solver

Experiment to create a super simple solver for the Irish language wordle game, foclach

Run the file locally per the instructions

Load the parquet file of irish language tokens into a pandas dataframe and instantiate the game object with it

PS - Special thanks to @michmech without whose irish language lemmas corpus this couldn't have been done
