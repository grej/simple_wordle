class WordleSolver:
    """A class for playing a Wordle Style game. Designed around building a simple
    solver for the Irish language version of the game Foclach.

    Object must be instantiated with a dataframe having the column structure as follows:

    word 	chars 	1 	2 	3 	4 	5   ... [letter_tokens]

    Usage: instantiate a game using the corpus
        >>> g = WordleGame(corpus_df)
        >>> guess = g.get_next_guess(); guess

        # input the guess into the game and get the clues in return
        # you can either use an array of ['gray', 'yellow', 'green']
        # or you can use a string. # If using a string, the key is:
        #   g = green (letter exists in correct location)
        #   y = yellow (letter exists but not in this location)
        #   r = gray (letter does not exists in the word)

        >>> g.update_clues_and_guess('gyrrr')
        >>> guess = g.get_next_guess(); guess

        of tokens from which the guess will be selected
